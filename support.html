            BOXXP+ was built by a single developer and fighter, with guidance from the friends and coaches who helped
            shape the boxing expertise inside the app. Every part of the experience was designed with simplicity in mind
            so that anyone, even those who aren’t tech-savvy, can download it and start training without friction.

            As the developer, I plan to continue improving and refining BOXXP+ over time to make sure it serves fighters
            at every level. If you have questions, feedback, or concerns, you can always reach me at:
